# All About Data Science and ML Algorithms 
> #### This github repo contains everything about machine learning algorithm in the framework of data science.



### CONTENTS
- [Datasets][sets]: All data sets that I use in applications are in this file.
    - Also, I store all the data sets I use in S3 service from Amazan Web Services (AWS) so that it doesn't take up too much disk space on my computer.
- [ML-Linear Regression][ml1]: This file contains the theory and application of all `linear regression` models from machine learning algorithms.
- [ML-NonLinear Regression][ml2]: This file contains the theory and application of all `non-linear regression` models from machine learning algorithms.
- [ML-Classification][ml3]: This file contains the theory and application of all `classification` models from machine learning algorithms.
- [ML-Unsupervised Learning][ml4]: This file contains the theory and application of all `unsupervised learning` models from machine learning algorithms.
- [ML-Exercises][ml_ex]: This file contains sample applications of all machine learning algorithms.
- [ML-Python Codes][ml_py]: In this file, there are applications of ML algorithms in the form of python file extension.

### APPLICATION STAGES
[x] 1. Examining and manipulating the dataset
2. Visualization
3. Modelling and testing the model
4. Conclusion
